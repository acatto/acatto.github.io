    <h1> Poetry </h1>

    <p>
      I mostly write haiku, thought I've been branching out and experimenting with new forms.
       Here are some of the pieces I've written.
      <h2>Haiku</h2>
Vacuous echoes<br>
Churn bountiful broken gears<br>
In the lonesome mind<br><br>

Riding manic waves<br>
Probabilities low now <br>
Many worlds collapse<br><br>

Waves, washing ashore<br>
Foaming probabilities<br>
Frame the multiverse<br><br>

Out in pouring rain <br>
Each drop bears timeless stories <br>
Reincarnate flow <br><br>

Our fingertips slip<br>
The piper calls you up now<br>
I'm stuck in his draft<br><br>

Several syllables<br>
Constricting prison for some<br>
Wonderland for me<br><br>

Curtains draw slowly<br>
Projecting worlds I once had<br>
Into quotient spaces<br><br>

Grave words strike softly<br>
To be etched on our tombstone<br>
We're buried alive<br><br>

Starry, starry night<br>
Words from the mouth of my youth<br>
Must Don a new Dawn<br><br>

She draws me in close<br>
Soul deep, dark, enigmatic<br>
Yet eyes crystalline<br><br>

Alas, time grows short<br>
The Mute voices yell softly<br>
In vast Empty space<br><br>

<h2> Rhythmic Poems </h2>

      The thoughts inside the formalist's mind<br>
      might sound quite pedantic<br>
      but who says all that of the rational kind<br>
      cannot be romantic?<br><br>

      That overwhelming urge to systematize<br>
      might sound quite pedantic<br>
      yet it does not imply that behind these eyes<br>
      lies grey matter unromantic<br><br>

      Encoding each and every line<br>
      might sound quite pedantic<br>
      but emerging from these symbolic signs<br>
      something wonderfully romantic<br><br>

      so laugh, so love, be free, be kind!<br>
      don't be too pedantic!<br>
      for rationality is blind<br>
      if it's not romantic!

  "Stochastic Winds" <br><br>
Towards me, eerie stochastic winds blow<br>
Strange waves, on which a bottle aglow<br>
Contains ink-soaked parchment, with my fate astow<br>
Line by line, from it I read<br>
Repeating the one thought I’ll come to know<br>
That I’d never be free<br><br>

Euphoria strikes me from the high tide<br>
Knowing the moon shines bright on my side<br>
Surfing manic waves I’d forever ride<br>
I cry out songs, ecstatic with glee<br>
The idea could never come to mind<br>
That still, I am not free<br><br>

The low tide took me by surprise<br>
Yet I was submerged, the sea stings my eyes<br>
It seeps into my ears, this ocean of lies<br>
Why has the moon turned against me?<br>
It was then that I’d finally internalize<br>
That I’d never be free<br><br>

Up rose a tsunami, guided by divine hands<br>
It made me believe I was more than a man<br>
Prophetic delusions, on which I now stand<br>
Modality, slowly becoming reality<br>
The voices whisper “it’s all part of their plan”<br>
I can’t, I won’t be free<br><br>

This exorcism I know too well<br>
Approaching near the gates of hell<br>
Past the horizon, to singularity I fell<br>
Too weak to scream, I follow cruel destiny<br>
“Draw me out of this morbid spell!”<br>
For alas, I am not free<br><br>

<h2>Prose Poems</h2>
"Abstract Pulsations"<br><br>
You are the abstract pulsations<br>
oscillating the fibers of my ego<br>
as if thrusting this inexplicable dualism through a compounded product space<br>
projecting away the awaiting componential singular doom<br>
and ourselves into a quotient space<br>
in which our atemporal paths shall reside;<br>
our images may be projected into real space<br>
but only locally<br>
as our modes are manifold<br>
yet substantially unified<br>
